# Exclusion Lists

Audience Hub allows you to define Exclusion Lists designed to make it easy to globally filter certain classes of contacts from datasets such that they will never appear in any segment or sync.&#x20;

Exclusion Lists are defined like any other segment in audience hub, using the visual builder. All the same conditions and filter logic is available to you for defining exclusion lists including relationships and SQL conditions.&#x20;

Once created, exclusions lists are automatically applied to every sync and segment created from that dataset, with no additional action required, whether Audience Hub is used to sync or not. This will be reflected both in segment sizes estimates as well as the records being synced to the destination.&#x20;

Exclusions lists can be enabled or disabled. Disabled exclusion lists will no longer filter segments and syncs, though they will still appear in the list of exclusion lists.&#x20;

Exclusion Lists can only be created, modified, and enabled/disabled by owners and admins in Census. For more information on access controls, see [Workspaces & Access Controls](../../misc/security-and-privacy/workspaces.md).
