# Criteo

Criteo provides a platform for digital marketing and advertising. With Census, you can sync data from your data warehouse to Criteo to create targeted marketing campaigns.

## Getting Started

The first step is connecting Census to your Criteo account.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Criteo can only be authorized once to any Census instance. In order to create a second connection, you'll need to deauthorize Census first inside the Criteo UI.\
\
This can be done by a Criteo Admin from the page consent.criteo.com
{% endhint %}

1. Log into Census and navigate to [Destinations](https://app.getcensus.com/destinations).
2. Click **New Destination**.
3. Select **Criteo** from the menu
4. Follow the Criteo OAuth authentication flow, which will ask you to log in with your Criteo username and password.
5. Once logged in, select the Portfolio's you want Census to have access to and Approve
6. Finally once back in Census you'll select the Audience

Once complete, you'll see your new connection in the **Destinations** list.
