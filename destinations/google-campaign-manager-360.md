# Google Campaign Manager 360

Google Campaign Manager 360 is a demand-side platform that allows advertisers to manage their digital campaigns across multiple channels.

## Getting Started

Census uses OAuth to connect to Google Campaign Manager 360. Before you start this flow, please make sure the user and accounts have the correct permissions:

* Your user will need access to the advertiser account you want to connect to
* The Campaign Manager 360 account is enabled for API Access
* Your User Profile permissions also have access to the API. For more information, see Google's [documentation](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/getting_started).

Once you've confirmed permissions, follow these steps to connect Census to Google Campaign Manager 360:

1. Navigate to the **Destinations** page in Census and click **New Destination**.
2. Select **Google Campaign Manager 360** from the menu.
3. Complete the OAuth flow to grant Census access. Note that you'll need to create a separate Census connection for each advertiser you wish to send data to.

### Conversion Identifiers

Each conversion record will need three things:

* A unique identifier that Census can use to identify new conversion events
* Conversion activity identifers
* Exactly one attribution identifier.

All conversions must be matched to existing activities by specifying the **floodlightActvityId** and **floodlightConfigurationId** values ([Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/guides/conversions_overview#match_conversions_to_activities)). These will appear as required mappings.

Offline conversions must also be attributed to a specific user through one of the [supported methods](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/guides/conversions_overview#match_conversions_to_activities), so you must add a mapping to exactly one of the following fields:

* Encrypted User ID
* Encrypted User ID Candidates
* Mobile Device ID
* Google Click ID
* Match ID
* Display Click ID

When using the Encrypted User ID, Encrypted User ID Candidates, you must specify Encryption Information in the sync's advanced configuration. See [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/guides/conversions_upload#specify_encryption_info) for more information.

### Digital Markets Act (DMA)

For syncing audiences to Google Campaign Manager 360, you can include consent information to ensure compatibility with [Google's EU User Consent Policy](https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy/). Google Campaign Manager 360 now supports an additional field `Consent for ad user data`, which can be set to one of the following values: `GRANTED`, `DENIED`. See Google's [documentation](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/rest/v4/Conversion#FIELDS.ad_user_data_consent) for more information.
