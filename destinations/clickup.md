# ClickUp

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the **Destinations** page in Census and click **New Destination**.
2. Select **ClickUp** from the menu.
3. Complete the OAuth flow to grant Census access to your ClickUp workspace. Note that you'll have to create a separate Census connection for each workspace you wish to send data to.
