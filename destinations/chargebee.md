‌In this guide, we will show you how to connect Chargebee to Census and create your first sync.

### Prerequisites

* Have your Census account ready. If you need one, [create a Free Trial Census account](https://app.getcensus.com/) now.
* Have your Chargebee account ready.
* Have the proper credentials to access to your data source. See our docs for each supported data source for further information:
  * [Databricks](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/databricks)
  * [Google BigQuery](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-bigquery)

### **1. Collect Your Credentials from Chargebee**

Census needs only your Chargebee **API token** and **sub domain** to connect you to your Chargebee instance.

* The API token can be found in your Chargebee **Settings** under **Configure Chargebee**
* The **sub domain** will be in your instance's URL and follow the structure _subdomain.chargebee_
