### 1. Generate a Kustomer API Key <a href="#id-1.-generate-a-planhat-api-key" id="id-1.-generate-a-planhat-api-key"></a>

In your Kustomer account:

1.  Navigate to **Settings > Security > API Key**

    `[KUSTOMER_DOMAIN].kustomerapp.com/app/settings/api_keys`
2. Create an **API Key** with the following permissions:
   1. `org.admin.klass.read`
   2. `org.user.kobject.read`
   3. `org.admin.metadata.read`
   4. `org.admin.search.read`
   5. `org.user.customer.write`
   6. `org.user.kobject.write`
   7. `org.permission.customer`
   8. `org.permission.company`
3. Hold onto this API Key for the next section, you'll need it!

In Kustomer, once a token is created, it will be created with those scopes and it is immutable. If there is a permission change, you will need to create a completely separate API key. Make sure to copy and store it securely once generated.

More on Kustomer's API permission scopes [here](https://help.kustomer.com/permissions-for-common-api-requests-HkltTBZbN).

### 2. Connect Kustomer to Census <a href="#id-2.-connect-planhat-to-census" id="id-2.-connect-planhat-to-census"></a>

* Head back to Census and navigate to [Destinations](https://app.getcensus.com/destinations).
* Click the New Destination button.
* Select Kustomer in the dropdown list.
* Paste your Kustomer account's **API Key**. Save your connection and if everything is set up correctly, you should see a successful connection test verifying the connection.
