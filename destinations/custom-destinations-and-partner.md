# Custom & Partner Destinations

## Custom Destinations

The Custom Destination API allows you to "bring your own" destination to Census. A custom destination is a few simple API endpoints that tell Census about the type of data your destination can process, the operations allowed on that data, and how to actually load that data.

See our full developer documentation at [**developers.getcensus.com/custom-destinations**](https://developers.getcensus.com/custom-destinations) for more information on how to build your own custom destinations.

## Publish your Custom Destination with Partner Destinations

A Partner Destination is a Custom Destination that is officially registered in our system and available for all users as if it were a first-class Census-built destination.

Please visit our full developer documentation at [**developers.getcensus.com/custom-destinations/partner-destinations**](https://developers.getcensus.com/custom-destinations/partner-destinations) for more.
