### 3. Connect to your Data Warehouse

Please follow one of our short guides depending on your data warehouse technology

* [Redshift](https://help.getcensus.com/article/10-configuring-redshift-postgresql-access)
* [Postgres](https://help.getcensus.com/article/10-configuring-redshift-postgresql-access)    
* [BigQuery](https://help.getcensus.com/article/21-configuring-bigquery-access)
* [Snowflake](https://help.getcensus.com/article/8-configuring-snowflake-access)

### 4. Create your first Model

Now navigate to the [Model section of our Dashboard](https://app.getcensus.com/models)

Here you will have to write SQL queries to select the data you want to see in ActiveCampaign. Here are some ideas of data you should select

* the Lifetime Value of a customer and add it to a contact or companies
* The end of their trial
* The date they became active in your product
* The number of key activities a user did in your app in the last 7/30 days

Once you have created your model, click save.

### 5. Create your first Sync

Now head to the [Sync page](https://app.getcensus.com/syncs) and click the **Add Sync** button

In the " **What data do you want to sync?"** section

* For the **Connection**, select the data warehouse you connected in step 2
* For the **Source,** select the model you created in step 3 

Next up is the **"Where do you want to sync data to?"** section

* Pick ActiveCampaign as **the Connection** 
* For Object, pick the one you want to sync data to; Contact or Account.

For the " **How should changes to the source be synced?"** section

* Select **Update or Create**
* Pick the right mapping key, it could be Email for Contacts, Account Name for Accounts.

Finally, select the fields you want to update in the Mapper in the **"Which Fields should be updated?"** section

* Here simply map the field from your ActiveCampaign instance to the column from your model.

The end result should look something like this

Click the **Next** button to see the final preview which will have a recap of what will happen when you start the sync

### 6. Confirm the data is in ActiveCampaign

Now go back to your ActiveCampaign and go view a record type \(Contact or Account\) that should have been updated. If everything went well, you should see your data in ActiveCampaign.

That's it! In 6 steps, you connected Census to ActiveCampaign and started syncing customer & account data from your warehouse to ActiveCampaign 🎉

## 🏎 Sync Speed

ActiveCampaign is syncing data at approximately 37,000 contact records per hour.

Due to limitations of the ActiveCampaign API, Account records will sync significantly slower.

* `Row skipped - It is on exclusion list` The record you're attempting to update appears on your ActiveCampaign instance's [Exclusion List](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/207362110-How-to-add-contacts-to-the-Exclusion-List) and can't be updated.
