# Gladly

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the **Destinations** page in Census and click **New Destination**.
2. Select **Gladly** from the menu.
3. Open Gladly in another browser tab and navigate to **Settings** > **API Tokens**. Create a new token and copy it to your clipboard.
4. Return to Census and enter your **API Token** along with your **User** and **Organization**. The former is the email address you log into Gladly with and the latter can be found in the URL when you're logged in (e.g. https://**your-org-name**.us-uat.gladly.qa).
