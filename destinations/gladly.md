## 🏃‍♀️ Getting Started

1. Navigate to the **Destinations** tab in Census and click **Add Destination**.

4. Return to Census and enter your **API Token** along with your **User** and **Organization**. The former is the email address you log into Gladly with and the latter can be found in the URL when you're logged in (e.g. https://**your-org-name**.us-uat.gladly.qa).
