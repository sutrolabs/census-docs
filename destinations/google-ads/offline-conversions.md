# Offline Conversions

## Connect your Google Ads Account

Follow the [set-up instructions here!](https://docs.getcensus.com/destinations/google-ads)

## Sync Offline Click and Call Conversions with Census

### 1. Create or find your custom conversion event in Google Ads

Google Ads has extensive documentation on [creating offline conversion events](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7012522?hl=en-GB). The main steps are:

1. Create a new conversion action.
2. Select the data source for this conversion action as **Import**.
3. Select **Other data sources or CRMs**.
4. Select **Track conversions from clicks** or **Track conversions from calls**.
5. Enter a name for the conversion action that you're creating. Hold onto this name exactly as entered -- spelling and capitalization will be important when syncing these conversions via Census!
6. Choose your [counting option](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/3438531?hl=en-GB) for the conversion action, either **One conversion** or **Every conversion**. Many offline conversions occur only once \(e.g. "Reached onboarding milestone X"\). In this case, select the counting option **One conversion** to protect yourself from accidentally syncing duplicate conversions.
7. Complete the set-up for this conversion event, selecting your desired conversion window \(we recommend using the maximum 90-days\) and ads attribution model.

**Important**: After creating a new conversion action, Google recommends waiting 6 hours before syncing conversions for that conversion action. If you sync conversions during the first 6 hours, it can take two days for those conversions to appear on your reports.
{% endhint %}

### 2. Create your Census Model for the Conversion Action

Navigate to the [Models](https://app.getcensus.com/models) page.​

Here you can write SQL queries that contain the conversion action you want to send to Google Ads.

Google Ads Offline Click and Call Conversions require a specific set of properties. We'll want a model that has the following three required fields:

* The **Google Click ID** \(also often known as the `gclid`\)
* The **Conversion Name**, spelled exactly as it is found in Google Ads
* The **Conversion Timestamp**, __with timezone specified -- either using your warehouse's "timestamp with timezone" datatype, or hard-coded in a string \(e.g. '2021-03-04 09:23:57+0000'\).

Optional properties include:

* Conversion Value, in [microunits](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/reference/v201809/BudgetService.Money#microamount) for the currency \(e.g. 1 USD = 1,000,000\)
* Currency Code, the[ ISO 4217 3-character currency code](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/codes-formats#expandable-18) \(e.g. 'USD'\)
* External Attribution Credit and Model, calculated outside Google Ads

Once you have created your model, click save.

### 3. Create your Sync

Now head to the [Sync page](https://app.getcensus.com/syncs) and click the **Add Sync** button

In the "**What data do you want to sync?"** section

* For the **Connection**, select the data warehouse you connected in the Prerequisites Step 2
* For the **Source,** select the model you created in step 2 of this section

Next up is the **"Where do you want to sync data to?"** section

* Pick **Google Ads** as the Connection
* For Object, pick **Click Conversion** or **Call Conversion**

For the "**How should changes to the source be synced?"** section 

* **Append** will be selected by default
* Pick the right mapping key, the **Google Click ID** in your model

Finally, select the fields you want to update in the Mapper in the **"Which Fields should be updated?"** section. Here simply map the fields from your model to the properties of the Click or Call Conversion. 

The end result should look something like this:

Click the **Next** button to see the final preview which will have a recap of what will happen when you start the sync.

### 4. Confirm the conversions are now in Google Ads

It may take around 3 hours for synced offline conversions to show up in your Google Ads account. When they do, they'll appear in reporting on these conversion actions.
