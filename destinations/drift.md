### 1. Connect Census to Drift

In the **Destinations** page in Census, Click the **New Destination** button under the **Destinations** section, and select Drift.

You will be redirected to a page to log in to Drift to authorize your account to Census. You will be prompted to enter your email and then your password. Once you click the **Sign In** button, you'll see a page like the image below, confirming you want to authorize Census.
