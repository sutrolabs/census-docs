### 3. Connect to your Data Warehouse

Please follow one of our short guides depending on your data warehouse technology

* [Redshift](https://help.getcensus.com/article/10-configuring-redshift-postgresql-access)
* [Postgres](https://help.getcensus.com/article/10-configuring-redshift-postgresql-access)
* [BigQuery](https://help.getcensus.com/article/21-configuring-bigquery-access)
* [Snowflake](https://help.getcensus.com/article/8-configuring-snowflake-access)

### 4. Create your first Model

Now navigate to the [Model section of our Dashboard](https://app.getcensus.com/models)

Here you can write a SQL query to select the data you want to see in Heap.io, or you can use a model from a dbt project or a Looker Look. Here are some ideas of data you could select

* The Lifetime Value of a customer and add it to a contact or companies
* The end of their trial
* The date they became active in your product
* The number of key activities a user did in your app in the last 7/30 days

Once you have created your model, click save.

### 5. Create your first Sync

Now head to the [Sync page](https://app.getcensus.com/syncs) and click the **Add Sync** button

In the " **What data do you want to sync?"** section

* For the **Connection**, select the data warehouse you connected in step 2
* For the **Source,** select the model you created in step 3

Next up is the **"Where do you want to sync data to?"** section

* Pick Autopilot as **the Connection**
* For Object, pick the one you want to sync data to; currently only Contact is available.

For the " **How should changes to the source be synced?"** section

* Select **Update or Create**
* Pick the right mapping key, it will be Email for Contacts.

Finally, select the fields you want to update in the Mapper in the **"Which Fields should be updated?"** section

* Here simply map the field from your Autopilot instance to the column from your model.

The end result should look something like

Click the **Next** button to see the final preview which will have a recap of what will happen when you start the sync

### 6. Confirm the data is in Autopilot

Now go back to your Autopilot and go view the record type (Contact) that should have been updated. If everything went well, you should see your data in Autopilot.
