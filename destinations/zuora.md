## Getting Started

* Have the proper credentials to access to your data source. See our docs for each supported data source for further information:
  * [Azure Synapse](../sources/available-sources/azure-synapse.md)
  * [Databricks](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/databricks)
  * [Elasticsearch](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/elasticsearch)
  * [Google BigQuery](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-bigquery)
  * [Google Sheets](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-sheets)
  * [MySQL](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/mysql)

### **1.** Collect your Zuora API Credentials

Census will need needs the following pieces of information to connect to your Zuora instance:

* Client ID
* Client Secret
* Rest API Endpoint

### 2. **Add the Destination**

Now that we have the credentials from Zuora, we can now set up Zuora as a Destination in Census.

1. In the **Destinations** tab of Census, go to your Destinations and click the **New Destination** button to create a new Zuora connection.
2. You can provide whatever name you like.
3. Provide your credentials collected from Zuora in Step 1.
4. Click **Connect**

### 3. Create your Model

Navigate to the [Model section of our Dashboard](https://app.getcensus.com/models)

Here you can write a SQL query to select the data you want to see in Zuora. You can also use tables or views already in your data warehouse or models from data transformation tools like dbt or Looker. Here are some ideas of data you could select

* The Lifetime Value of a customer
* The end date of a user's trial
* The date a user became active in your product
* The number of key activities a user did in your app in the last 7/30 days

Once you have created your model, click **Save Model**.
