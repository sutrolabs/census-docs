### 1. Copy your Vitally API Key

2. Select **Integrate via HTTPS API**
3. Copy the key out of the **API Key** box

## 🗄 Supported Objects

| **Object Name** | **Supported?** | Matching Keys | Create Fields |
| ---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Users | ✅ | User ID only | ✅ |
| Accounts | ✅ | Account ID only | ✅ |
| Event | 🔜 |  |  |
| NPS | 🔜 |  |  |

Vitally defines User ID and Account ID as the unique ID for these objects in your system. You are free to use whatever ID you like, but it needs to be unique. 

### User Behavior Notes

* Users must have at least one Account in Vitally so **Accounts** is a required field when syncing to users. It's also an Array field so it you'll need to provide it an array value or JSON formatted Array.
* Any Account ID values used when mapping to  that don't already exist in Vitally will be automatically created.

## 🔍 Additional Service Quirks

* Vitally's internal database has a delay between Census completing its upload and having those results reflected in the UI. This delay can be a couple seconds to a couple minutes in extreme cases.
