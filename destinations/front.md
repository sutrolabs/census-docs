# Front

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/20857381085a40fbb707bb43b522ff9d" %}

In this guide, we will show you how to connect your Front instance to [Census](https://www.getcensus.com/) and create your first sync.

### 0. Prerequisites

* [Create a Free Trial Census Account](https://app.getcensus.com/)
* Have your Front account ready as we will be connecting Census to Front via OAuth
* Have the credential to access your warehouse. You can find our guides for each data warehouse here: [Redshift](https://help.getcensus.com/article/10-configuring-redshift-postgresql-access), [Postgres](https://help.getcensus.com/article/10-configuring-redshift-postgresql-access), [BigQuery](https://help.getcensus.com/article/21-configuring-bigquery-access), [Snowflake](https://help.getcensus.com/article/8-configuring-snowflake-access).

### 1. Connect Front

* In Census, navigate to [Connections](https://app.getcensus.com/connections)
* Click the Add Service button
* Select Front in the dropdown list

Follow the OAuth flow to connect Front. Your end state should look something like this 👇

### 2. Connect your Data Warehouse

Please follow one of our short guides depending on your data warehouse technology

* [Redshift](https://help.getcensus.com/article/10-configuring-redshift-postgresql-access)
* [Postgres](https://help.getcensus.com/article/10-configuring-redshift-postgresql-access)
* [BigQuery](https://help.getcensus.com/article/21-configuring-bigquery-access)
* [Snowflake](https://help.getcensus.com/article/8-configuring-snowflake-access)

After setting up your warehouse, your Census Connections page should look like this:

### 3. Create your first Model

Navigate to the [Models](https://app.getcensus.com/models)

Here you can write SQL queries or select dbt models that contain the data you want to see in Front. Here are some ideas of data you should select:

* The Lifetime Value of a customer and add it to a contact
* The end of their trial
* The date they became active in your product
* The number of key activities a user did in your app in the last 7/30 days

Once you have created your model, click save.

### 4. Create your first Sync

Now head to the [Syncs page](https://app.getcensus.com/syncs) and click the Add Sync button, which will take you to a step-by-step wizard for building a data mapping.

In the "What data do you want to sync?" section

* For the Connection, select the data warehouse you connected in step 2
* For the Source, select the model you created in step 3

Next up is the "Where do you want to sync data to?" section

* Pick Front as the Connection
* Pick Contact as the Object

For the "How should changes to the source be synced?" section 

* Select **Update Or Create**
* Pick the appropriate mapping key, it could be email or a custom unique ID

Finally, select the fields you want to update in the mapper in the "Which Fields should be updated?" section

* For each field in your Front instance, you can choose a column from your model.

Click the Next button to see a preview of what will happen when you start the sync. You can check the "Run Sync Now" checkbox to kick off an initial sync and pick a schedule afterwards.

### 5. Confirm the data is in Front

Now go back to Front and go view a Contact that should have been updated. If everything went well, you should see your data in Front.

That's it, in 5 steps, you connected Census to Front and started syncing customer & product data from your warehouse to Front 🎉

## 🏎 Sync Speed

The Front API is pretty slow with a [default rate limit of 10 calls / minute](https://dev.frontapp.com/docs/core-api-getting-started#limitations). If you are on the Enterprise plan, this can be boosted to 200 calls / minute. 

Rest assured that Census will manage that API rate limit for you and ensure that all your syncs are successful. 

| **Service** | Public API rate limit | **Records sync / Minute** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| This Service \(Front\) | 100 calls / minute | ~40 |
| Front Enterprise | 200 calls / minute | ~80 |
| Salesforce \(as a reference\) | 20,000 \(default\) | 10,000 |

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that you can contact your Front Customer Success Manager to increase your API rate limit temporarly which will increase the number of records we can sync per minute.
{% endhint %}
