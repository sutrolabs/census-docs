In this guide, we will show you how to connect Front to Census and create your first sync.

{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/20857381085a40fbb707bb43b522ff9d" %}

### Prerequisites

* Have your Census account ready. If you need one, [create a Free Trial Census account](https://app.getcensus.com/) now.
* Have your Front account ready.
* Have the proper credentials to access to your data source. See our docs for each supported data source for further information:
  * [Azure Synapse](../sources/available-sources/azure-synapse.md)
  * [Databricks](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/databricks)
  * [Elasticsearch](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/elasticsearch)
  * [Google BigQuery](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-bigquery)
  * [Google Sheets](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-sheets)
  * [MySQL](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/mysql)
  * [Postgres](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/postgres)
  * [Redshift](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/redshift)
  * [Snowflake](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/snowflake)
  * [SQL Server](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/sql-server)

### 1. Connect Front

* In Census, navigate to [Destinations](https://app.getcensus.com/destinations)

### 2. Connect your Data Warehouse

Please follow one of our short guides depending on your data warehouse technology

* [Redshift](https://help.getcensus.com/article/10-configuring-redshift-postgresql-access)
* [Postgres](https://help.getcensus.com/article/10-configuring-redshift-postgresql-access)
* [BigQuery](https://help.getcensus.com/article/21-configuring-bigquery-access)
* [Snowflake](https://help.getcensus.com/article/8-configuring-snowflake-access)

After setting up your warehouse, your Census Destinations page should look like this:

### 3. Create your first Model

Navigate to the [Models](https://app.getcensus.com/models)

Here you can write SQL queries or select dbt models that contain the data you want to see in Front. Here are some ideas of data you should select:

* The Lifetime Value of a customer and add it to a contact
* The end of their trial
* The date they became active in your product
* The number of key activities a user did in your app in the last 7/30 days

Once you have created your model, click save.

### 4. Create your first Sync

Now head to the [Syncs page](https://app.getcensus.com/syncs) and click the Add Sync button, which will take you to a step-by-step wizard for building a data mapping.

In the "What data do you want to sync?" section

* For the Connection, select the data warehouse you connected in step 2
* For the Source, select the model you created in step 3

Next up is the "Where do you want to sync data to?" section

* Pick Front as the Connection
* Pick Contact as the Object

For the "How should changes to the source be synced?" section

* Select **Update Or Create**
* Pick the appropriate mapping key, it could be email or a custom unique ID

Finally, select the fields you want to update in the mapper in the "Which Fields should be updated?" section

* For each field in your Front instance, you can choose a column from your model.

Click the Next button to see a preview of what will happen when you start the sync. You can check the "Run Sync Now" checkbox to kick off an initial sync and pick a schedule afterwards.

### 5. Confirm the data is in Front

Now go back to Front and go view a Contact that should have been updated. If everything went well, you should see your data in Front.

That's it, in 5 steps, you connected Census to Front and started syncing customer & product data from your warehouse to Front üéâ

## Sync Speed

The Front API is pretty slow with a [default rate limit of 10 calls / minute](https://dev.frontapp.com/docs/core-api-getting-started#limitations). If you are on the Enterprise plan, this can be boosted to 200 calls / minute.

Rest assured that Census will manage that API rate limit for you and ensure that all your syncs are successful.

| **Service**                 | Public API rate limit | **Records sync / Minute** |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| This Service (Front)        | 100 calls / minute    | \~40                      |
| Front Enterprise            | 200 calls / minute    | \~80                      |
| Salesforce (as a reference) | 20,000 (default)      | 10,000                    |

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that you can contact your Front Customer Success Manager to increase your API rate limit temporarly which will increase the number of records we can sync per minute.
{% endhint %}
