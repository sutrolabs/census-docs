### :electric\_plug:Connecting Shopify

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Census will only query Shopify based on the syncs/objects that you configure
{% endhint %}

1.  Census connects via OAuth, so you need a Shopify user that can login to the instance with the following permission scopes:

    | write\_products                               | read\_products                               |
    | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
    | write\_customers                              | read\_customers                              |
    | write\_orders                                 | read\_orders                                 |
    | write\_inventory                              | read\_inventory                              |
    | write\_fulfillments                           | read\_fulfillments                           |
    | write\_assigned\_fulfillment\_orders          | read\_assigned\_fulfillment\_orders          |
    | write\_merchant\_managed\_fulfillment\_orders | read\_merchant\_managed\_fulfillment\_orders |
    | write\_third\_party\_fulfillment\_orders      | read\_third\_party\_fulfillment\_orders      |
2. There is some setup that is needed to do on the Census side to setup Shopify, while this process is under construction :construction\_site:, please contact the support team via email or start a conversation with us via the [in-app](https://app.getcensus.com) chat with the topic: "Shopify Setup". In your communication please provide your Shopify Store URL so we can get started on your set up!

## Supported Objects and Sync Behaviors <a href="#supported-objects-and-sync-behaviors" id="supported-objects-and-sync-behaviors"></a>

Census currently supports syncing to the following Shopify objects and Sync Behaviors (contact the support team if you're looking for more!):

| **Object Name** | **Supported?** | **Sync Keys**         | **Behaviors**                 |
| --------------: | :------------: | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |

| Inventory Level |        ✅       | N/A                   | Update or Create              |
|           Order |        ✅       | Source ID             | Update or Create, Update Only |

Census also supports Shopify's Custom Metafields on Customer and Product as well.

{% hint style="info" %}
Learn more about all of our sync behaviors in our [Syncs](../syncs/overview.md) documentation.
{% endhint %}

Contact the support team if you want Census to support more Shopify objects and/or behaviors.

#### Updating Product Images

Census supports setting product images by passing an [Array](../syncs/structuring-data/structured-data.md) to the `images` field on the Product. The images array needs to be a set of one more objects that contain URLs to each image you want to upload. It should look something like the following:

```
[
  {
    "position": 1,
    "src": "https://via.placeholder.com/300.png?text=iPod%20Nano,%208GB",
    "width": 640,
    "height": 480
  }
]
```

Only the `src` field is required. `position`, `width`, and `height` are optional.
