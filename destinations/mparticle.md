# mParticle

mParticle is a customer data platform that simplifies how you collect and connect your user data to hundreds of vendors without needing to manage multiple integrations.

## 🏃‍♀️ Getting Started

1. You'll first need to create an Key and Secret in mParticle. For more information on setting up Keys and Secrets in mParticle, [see their documentation](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/credential-management/).
2. Back in Census, navigate to the Destinations page and click **Add Destination**. Select mParticle from the list of destinations. Provide your Key and Secret, choose your Environment and click **Connect**.

You should now be ready to start sending data to mParticle!
