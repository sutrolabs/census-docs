# Singular

Singular can help you get a complete view of ROI with next-gen attribution,\
full-funnel marketing data, and best-in-class fraud prevention. Census can sync your event data to Singular via their server-to-server (S2S) integration.

## Getting Started

In order to connect Census to Singular, all that is required is your **SDK Key**. This can be found in your Singular dashboard; follow these steps:

1. Log in to Singular
2. On the sidebar, navigate to **Developer Tools > SDK Integration**
3. Choose the **SDK Keys** tab
4. Click **Show Keys**, and copy the **SDK Key**. You will not need the **SDK Secret**.
5. Back within Census, go to the [Destinations](https://app.getcensus.com/destinations) page in Census and click **New Destination**.
6. Select **Singular** from the menu.
7. Enter the **SDK Key** that you copied in step 4.

You should now be ready to sync your data to Singular.
