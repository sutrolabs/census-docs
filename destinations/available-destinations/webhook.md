# Webhooks

We recently launched an [http-request.md](http-request.md "mention") destination that provides a flexible, no-code interface for sending data to any service that accepts standard HTTP requests. It provides all the same functionality as our Webhooks destination (and much more).

As a result, **we've deprecated our Webhooks destination**. This means that any existing Webhook syncs will continue to run, but you won't be able to create new ones.

Please reach out to support@getcensus.com if you have any questions!
