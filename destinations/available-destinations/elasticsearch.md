## 1. Collect your Elasticsearch Credentials

Census needs the following information to create an Elasticsearch cloud connection:

* Cloud ID - this can be found in your Elasticsearch cloud instance by clicking Help -> Connection Details

## Supported Objects and Behaviors <a href="#supported-objects-and-behaviors" id="supported-objects-and-behaviors"></a>

Elasticsearch stores data within collections called Models. Your Models in Elasticsearch can be used as objects to sync to from Census.

| **Object Name** | **Supported?** | **Sync Keys** | **Behaviors**                     |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Index           | âœ…              | Document ID   | <p>Update or Create<br>Mirror</p> |

Contact our support team if you want Census to support more objects for Elasticsearch.\
