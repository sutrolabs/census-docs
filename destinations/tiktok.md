## Understanding TikTok Audiences

TikTok supports two different audience types: Partner Audiences and Customer File Audiences. Though they are similar, there are some important differences to note. When in doubt, we recommend using Partner Audiences.

You can enable an audience for Reach and Frequency campaigns using the toggle in the advanced configuration settings of a sync.

### Partner Audiences

Partner Audiences are easier to manage with Census as they have no limitations on incremental syncs.&#x20;

### Customer File Audience

TikTok only allows one **Replace** operation per 24 hrs (sometimes a bit longer, depends on their processing delays) when using this API. This can present issues. This error will appear as:

```
This replace operation is rejected as there is an existing unfinished replace operation for this audience. Please wait until the current operation completes on this audience before re trying. Recommend no more than one replace operation per day.
```

To work around this limitation, you have a few options:

* Use a **Partner Audience** instead
* Move to a less frequent sync schedule (once per 48 hrs)
* Use the **Update or Create** sync behavior instead of **Replace** by setting the `When a record is removed from source data` option to `Do Nothing` on sync set up

### Identifiers

TikTok supports the following identifiers across either audience type:

* **Email** - Original value or SHA256 hashed
* **Phone** - Original value or SHA256 hashed
* **IDFA/GAID** - Original value, SHA256 hashed, or MD5 hashed

Prior to hashing, please ensure you are [normalizing your data to TikTok's requirements](https://ads.tiktok.com/gateway/docs/index?identify_key=2b9b4278e47b275f36e7c39a4af4ba067d088e031d5f5fe45d381559ac89ba48\&language=ENGLISH\&doc_id=1701890972946433#item-link-Before%20you%20begin).

#### Important Notes

* All audience identifiers can be provided as either the original value or a hashed value.
