# Algolia

## Getting Started

In this guide, we will show you how to connect Algolia to Census and create your first sync.

### 1. Collect your Algolia Credentials

Census needs the following information to create an Algolia connection, both of which can be found in the same page.&#x20;

First, ensure your desired application is selected in the Application dropdown menu of the Algolia UI. Then navigate to the **Settings** page then click on the **API Keys** option under **Teams & Access.**

* **Application ID** - The alphanumeric string at the top of the **Your API Keys** tab.
* **API Key** - Census uses the `listIndexes`, `search`, and `addObject` permissions. We recommend you create a new API key by navigating to the **All API Keys** tab and pressing **New API Key**. Provide at least those permissions in the ACL section. You can optionally restrict Census to a specific set of indexes as well.&#x20;

### 2. Connect Algolia in Census

* In Census, navigate to [Destinations](https://app.getcensus.com/destinations)
* Click the **New Destination** button
* Select Algolia in the dropdown list
* Enter your credentials and click **Connect**

## Supported Objects and Behaviors

Algolia stores data within collections called Indices. Your Indices in Algolia can be used as objects to sync to from Census.
