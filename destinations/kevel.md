### Understanding Kevel Interests/Flight Categories

You can think of Kevel interests as "tags" on users within UserDB indicating the types of campaigns that should be targeted at them. Kevel also calls them Flight Categories. Currently, you must first create an Interest/Flight Category in Kevel before you can sync users to it via Census. You can do this by navigating to **Campaigns > Flights** in the top bar menu. Then add categories under the **Behavioral Targeting** section.

You can also use Custom Targeting via Kevel's Zerkel queries by specifying a key-value pair for your targeting condition (E.G. `category = sports`). For more information, see [Kevel's documentation](https://dev.kevel.com/docs/interest-targeting#how-to-target-an-interest-segment).
