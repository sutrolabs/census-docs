# Microsoft Teams

## Getting Started

‚ÄåIn this guide, we will show you how to connect Microsoft Teams to Census.

### üìã Prerequisites

* Have your Census account ready. If you need one, [create a Free Trial Census account](https://app.getcensus.com/) now.
* Have your Teams account ready.
* Have the proper credentials to access to your data source. See our [docs](../sources/) for each supported data source for further information.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect Census to Teams

In the [**Destinations**](https://app.getcensus.com/destinations) page in Census, Click the **New Destination** button in the top right, and select Microsoft Teams.

If you are not already logged in to Teams, you will be redirected to a page to log in to authorize your account to use Census. Once you've authorized Census, you'll be redirected back to the Destinations page in Census where you'll see your Teams connection.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Connect Census to your data source

See our [docs](../sources/) for each supported data source for further information.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create your first Census model

Navigate to the **Models** page in Census and click the **Add Model** button.

Here you can a write SQL query to select the data you want to send to Teams.

Once you have created your model, give it a useful name, and click **Save Model**.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Sync

Navigate to the [**Syncs**](https://app.getcensus.com/syncs) page in Census and click the **New Sync** button.

### üéö Setup your Source, Destination, and Sync Key

You'll need to start by specifying how to identify entries in your data warehouse that should trigger a Sync:

* For Source > **Connection**, select the data warehouse you connected in step 2.
* For Source > **Source**, select the model you created in step 3.
* For Destination > **Connection**, select Microsoft Teams
* For Destination > **Object**, Message should be auto-selected
* Next, pick the column that uniquely identifies each record in your data source. Census will use this to identify new records that need to be used to send messages to Microsoft.

### üí¨ **Setup your Message**

* Select the Teams channel you'd like to send messages to.
* Finally, use the text editor to customize the message that you wish to send.
  * To embed values from the trigger columns or to mention users or channels from your Teams account, use the dropdown that will appear. If the list is long, try the search function.
