# Delighted

## Getting Started

In this guide, we'll show you how to connect Delighted to Census and create your first sync.

### Prerequisites

* Have your Census account ready. If you need one, [create a Free Trial Census account](https://app.getcensus.com/) now.
* Have your Delighted account ready,
* Have the proper credentials to access your data source. See our docs for each supported data source for further information:
  * [Azure Synapse](../sources/available-sources/azure-synapse.md)
  * [Databricks](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/databricks)
  * [Elasticsearch](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/elasticsearch)
  * [Google BigQuery](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-bigquery)
  * [Google Sheets](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-sheets)
  * [MySQL](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/mysql)
  * [Postgres](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/postgres)
  * [Redshift](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/redshift)
  * [Snowflake](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/snowflake)

### 2. Create your first Model

Now navigate to the [models page](https://app.getcensus.com/models) in your Census account.

Here you will have to write SQL queries to select the data you want to send to your Delighted account. Your model can be a complex query selecting details about customers and generating metrics, or as simple as a `SELECT * FROM ...`, it's up to you. Once you have created your model, click **Save Model**.

Now head to the [Sync page](https://app.getcensus.com/syncs) and click the **Create a Sync** button.

From there, select your object. Here's an example of how that should look:

You should be able to view your data in Delighted now.
