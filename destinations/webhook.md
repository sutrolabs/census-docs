# Webhooks

We recently launched an [http-request.md](http-request.md "mention") destination that provides a flexible, no-code interface for sending data to any service that accepts standard HTTP requests. It provides all the same functionality as our Webhooks destination (and much more).

As a result, **we've deprecated our Webhooks destination**. This means that any existing Webhook syncs will continue to run, but you won't be able to create new ones.

Please reach out to the support team if you have any questions!
