### 1. Collect your Pendo Credentials

Census needs the below pieces of information to connect you to your Pendo Instance instance:

* **A) Pendo Integration Key**
* **B) Track Event Shared Secret Key**

These can be obtained by navigating to `Settings > Subscription Settings > App Details` and copying the `API Key` and `Track Event Shared Secret` values.

### 1A. Create a Pendo Integration key

Pendo lets you create a number of Integration keys. You should create a new API key for Census rather than reusing an existing one.

Within Pendo's left navigation bar, click the **Settings** ⚙️icon and select **Integrations** from the popup menu. Then, inside the **Integration Keys** tab, click **+ Add Integration Key**.

Provide a name you'll recognize ("Census" is a good choice) and check the **Allow Write Access**. Save your new key.

Finally, copy the long code you see under **Key**. We'll use that in a minute.

### 1B. Collect the Track Event Shared Secret Key

This key is different from the subscription key that appears in your Pendo installation snippet or integration keys. A Pendo Admin can access this key in your app settings _(_[_Subscription Settings_](https://app.pendo.io/admin) _> Choose your App > App Details)_

## 🔄 Supported Sync Behaviors

{% hint style="info" %}
Learn more about all of our sync behaviors on our [Core Concepts page](../basics/core-concept/#the-different-sync-behaviors).
{% endhint %}

|        **Behaviors** | **Supported?** |   **Objects?**  |
| -------------------: | :------------: | :-------------: |
|      **Update Only** |        ✅       | Account/Visitor |
| **Update or Create** |        ✅       | Account/Visitor |

{% hint style="warning" %}
For Pendo, "Update or Create" syncs will take longer than "Update Only" syncs. This is because - for newly created accounts and visitors - Pendo processes the previous hour’s data at the top of the hour. In addition, it may take up to 15 minutes for the data to fully appear in the UI.\
\
Census will wait until \~15 minutes after the top of the hour to then update the newly created visitor or account with additional properties that are part of the sync.
{% endhint %}

[Contact us](mailto:support@getcensus.com) if you want Census to support more Sync Behaviors for Pendo.
