* Have your Pendo account ready, with create access for Pendo Integration keys.
* Have the proper credentials to access to your data source. See our docs for each supported data source for further information:

### 1. Create a Pendo Integration key

Pendo lets you create a number of Integration keys. You should create a new API key for Census rather than reusing an existing one.

Within Pendo's left navigation bar, click the **Settings** ⚙️icon and select **Integrations** from the popup menu. Then, inside the **Integration Keys** tab, click **+ Add Integration Key**.

Provide a name you'll recognize \("Census" is a good choice\) and check the **Allow Write Access**. Save your new key.

Finally, copy the long code you see under **Key**. We'll use that in a minute.

1. In the **Settings** tab, Create a new Pendo Service Connection in Census.  ![](../.gitbook/assets/screely-1624583177140.png)
