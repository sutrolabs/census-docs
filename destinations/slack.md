# Slack

## Getting Started

‚ÄåIn this guide, we will show you how to connect Slack to Census.

### üìã Prerequisites

* Have your Census account ready. If you need one, [start a free trial now](https://app.getcensus.com/) (or take a look at our [pricing for paid plans](https://www.getcensus.com/pricing)).
* Have your Slack account ready.
* Have the proper credentials to access to your data source. See our [docs](broken-reference/) for each supported data source for further information.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect Census to Slack

In the [**Destinations**](https://app.getcensus.com/destinations) page in Census, Click the **New Destination** button in the top right, and select Slack.

If you are not already logged in to Slack, you will be redirected to a page to log in to Slack to authorize your account to use Census. Once you are logged in, you'll see a page like the image below, confirming you want to authorize Census.

Once you've authorized Census, you'll be redirected back to the Destinations page in Census and you should see your Slack connection there.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Connect Census to your data source

See our [docs](broken-reference/) for each supported data source for further information.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create your first Census dataset

Navigate to the **Dataset** page in Census and click the **Add Dataset** button.

Here you can a write SQL query to select the data you want to send to Slack.

Once you have created your dataset, give it a useful name, and click **Save Dataset**.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Create your Census Sync

Navigate to the [**Syncs**](https://app.getcensus.com/syncs) page in Census and click the **New Sync** button.

### üéö Setup your Source, Destination, and Sync Key

You'll need to start by specifying how to identify entries in your data warehouse that should trigger a Sync:

* For Source > **Connection**, select the data warehouse you connected in step 2.
* For Source > **Source**, select the dataset you created in step 3.
* For Destination > **Connection**, select Slack
* For Destination > **Object**, Message should be auto-selected
* Next, pick the column that uniquely identifies each record in your data source. Census will use this to identify new records that need to be used to send messages to Slack.

### üí¨ **Setup your Message**

* Select the Slack channel you'd like to send messages to.
* Finally, use the text editor to customize the message that you wish to send.
  * To embed values from the trigger columns or to mention users or channels from your Slack account, use the dropdown that will appear. If the list is long, try the search function.

Reminder: Census will send records to a Slack channel one at a time.
{% endhint %}

## Dynamic User Mentions

The Member ID can be used to mention specific channel members in a Slack message.

Example:

<pre><code>select '&#x3C;@U012345>' as USER_MENTION_1
<strong>        ,'@U012345' as USER_MENTION_2
</strong></code></pre>

## Hyperlinks <a href="#supported-objects-and-sync-behaviors" id="supported-objects-and-sync-behaviors"></a>

To add hyperlinks there are a couple of ways to include them based on your goal.&#x20;

* If you have a static list that won't be changing from record to record the template editor supports highlighting the text you want linked and copy and pasting the link to automatically hyperlink.&#x20;
* If you want dynamic hyperlinks that vary based on the record you can create a column within your source data formatted like the below and reference the hyperlink column in your message template. &#x20;

```
SELECT '<http://example.com/test | Text to display>' as hyperlink
```
