# Google Display & Video 360

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the **Destinations** page in Census and click **New Destination**.
2. Select **Google Display & Video 360** from the menu.
3. Complete the OAuth flow to grant Census access to DV360. Note that you'll need to create a separate Census connection for each advertiser you wish to send data to.

### Syncing Audiences

DV360 contains a number of different [audience types](https://developers.google.com/display-video/api/reference/rest/v2/firstAndThirdPartyAudiences#audiencetype) but we only support syncing to `CUSTOMER_MATCH_CONTACT_INFO` and `CUSTOMER_MATCH_DEVICE_ID`. Which audience type we sync to depends on the mappings you select in the sync wizard.

If you want to sync to an audience of type `CUSTOMER_MATCH_DEVICE_ID` then you should only map to the `appId` and `deviceId` fields.

If you want to sync to an audience of type `CUSTOMER_MATCH_CONTACT_INFO` you can map to any field _except_ `appId` and `deviceId`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You cannot mix audience types in a single sync. If you map to the deviceId field you should not add any customer info fields and vice versa.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are syncing customer info and you map to an address field (First Name, Last Name, Country Code, Zip Code) then you must map _all_ the address fields.
{% endhint %}

### Digital Markets Act (DMA)

For syncing audiences to DV360, you can include consent information to ensure compatibility with [Google's EU User Consent Policy](https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy/). DV360 now supports two additional fields `Consent for ad user data` and `Consent for ad personalization`, which can be set to one of the following values: `CONSENT_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED`, `CONSENT_STATUS_GRANTED`, `CONSENT_STATUS_DENIED`. See Google's [documentation](https://developers.google.com/display-video/api/reference/rest/v3/firstAndThirdPartyAudiences#ContactInfoList.FIELDS.consent) for more information.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're seeing low match rates, try adding these consent fields. Match rates can be impacted if consent preferences are not included.
{% endhint %}
