# Partnerstack

PartnerStack is a partner relationship management platform that helps you manage and scale your partnerships. Use Census to send customer attributes and transaction events to PartnerStack automatically.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the **Destinations** page in Census and click **New Destination**.
2. Select **PartnerStack** from the menu.
3. Open the PartnerStack app in another window. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** and copy the relevant API keys (either Test or Production).
4. Return to Census and paste them into the **Public Key** and **Secret Key** fields, respectively.

Contact the support team if you want Census to support more Partner Stack objects and/or behaviors

### Transactions

Transactions are sent to PartnerStack as events so each transaction must have a unique identifier so Census can correctly identify them, but that ID is not passed along to PartnerStack. Transactions need to be associated with a customer in PartnerStack, so you must include at exactly one of the following keys in your transaction data:

* customer\_key - The PartnerStack unique identifier for the customer
* customer\_external\_key - Your unique identifier for the customer
* customer\_email - The customer's email address
