### Prerequisites

* Have your Census account ready. If you need one, [create a Free Trial Census account](https://app.getcensus.com) now.
* Have your HubSpot account ready.
* Have the proper credentials to access to your data source. See our docs for each supported data source for further information:
  * [Databricks](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/databricks)
  * [Google BigQuery](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-bigquery)
  * [Google Sheets](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/google-sheets)
  * [Postgres](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/postgres)
  * [Redshift](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/redshift)
  * [Rockset](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/rockset)
  * [Snowflake](https://docs.getcensus.com/sources/snowflake)

### 1. Connect HubSpot

* Click the **Add Service** button

### 2. Connect your Data Warehouse

Please follow one of our short guides depending on your data warehouse technology

* [Redshift](https://help.getcensus.com/article/10-configuring-redshift-postgresql-access)
* [Postgres](https://help.getcensus.com/article/10-configuring-redshift-postgresql-access)
* [BigQuery](https://help.getcensus.com/article/21-configuring-bigquery-access)
* [Snowflake](https://help.getcensus.com/article/8-configuring-snowflake-access)

After setting up your warehouse, your Census Connections Page should look like this

### 3. Create your first Model

Now navigate to the [Model section of our Dashboard](https://app.getcensus.com/models)

Here you will have to write SQL queries to select the data you want to see in HubSpot. Here are some ideas of data you should select

* The Lifetime Value of a customer and add it to a contact or companies
* The end of their trial
* The date they became active in your product
* The number of key activities a user did in your app in the last 7/30 days

Once you have created your model, click save.&#x20;

### 4. Create your first Sync

Now head to the [Sync page](https://app.getcensus.com/syncs) and click the **Add Sync** button

In the " **What data do you want to sync?"** section

* For the **Connection**, select the data warehouse you connected in step 2
* For the **Source,**  select the model you created in step 3

Next up is the **"Where do you want to sync data to?"** section

* Pick HubSpot as **the Connection**
* For Object, pick the one you want to sync data to; Contact or Company.

For the " **How should changes to the source be synced?"** section&#x20;

* Select **Update Only**
* Pick the right mapping key, it could be Email for Contacts, Domain for Companies but we recommend you use your own internal id if possible

Finally, select the fields you want to update in the Mapper in the **"Which Fields should be updated?"** section

* Here simply map the field from your HubSpot instance to the column from your model.

The end result should look something like this

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bb7d5d0042863158cc71f7e/images/5f656a5c4cedfd00173b9a55/file-iowohMcQax.png)

Click the **Next** button to see the final preview which will have a recap of what will happen when you start the sync

### 5. Confirm the data is in HubSpot

Now go back to your HubSpot and go view a record type (Contact or Company) that should have been updated. If everything went well, you should see your data in HubSpot

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5bb7d5d0042863158cc71f7e/images/5f656c764cedfd00176363f8/file-aQC3QWxxq7.png)

that's it, in 5 steps, you connect Census to HubSpot and started syncing customer & product data from your warehouse to HubSpot 🎉

## 🏎 Sync Speed

With HubSpot, you have both a rate limit and a daily api call limit that is tied to the plan you have. [See HubSpot documentation here](https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/apps/api\_guidelines). HubSpot doesn't have the concept of bulk API so every call is roughly a record being sync.

| **Service**                 | Public API rate limit | **Records sync / Minute** |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| HubSpot (Free & Start Plan) | 600 calls / min       | \~600                     |
| HubSpot (Pro & Enterprise)  | 900 calls / min       | \~900                     |
| API Boost Add-on            | 1,200 calls / min     | \~1,200                   |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please be aware that with custom object, we need to do extra call due to the limiation of HubSpot' API. You can divide the records sync / minute by 3 to get a good estimation.
{% endhint %}

[Contact us](mailto:support@getcensus.com) if you want Census to support more objects for HubSpot.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If possible when doing Update Only syncs, use HubSpot Object IDs as your Sync Identifier. Using them will provide a dramatic sync performance boost!
{% endhint %}

* As of March 2021, only properties in the searchableProperties set are usable as sync identifiers to HubSpot Custom Objects. This is a bit confusing as this label only appears in the HubSpot API ([Custom Objects API Docs](https://t.sidekickopen08.com/s3t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cFC2RW1K7Z1759hl3kW7\_k2841CXdp3VP16Md1G7ysXW2dykfC1TtC07101?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW3H4THp3ZZnXLW49Rd2x4hCWyFW43X00w43T4NTW43P1-Z3zfPd7W3FcKxL3FcKxJW3Fd-wl43T4CBw3C9Ryyb7l2\&si=8000000004039937\&pi=71ef6659-f8eb-4943-8de6-e67c9ea6453c) > Object Definitions Tab > searchableProperties). If you need a hand making one of your existing Custom Object fields as searchable, please contact Census' API Support team and we can walk you through it.&#x20;
