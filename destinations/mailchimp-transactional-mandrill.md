# Mailchimp Transactional (Mandrill)

Mailchimp Transactional, formerly known as Mandrill, is a transactional email API for Mailchimp users. It's a powerful, scalable, and secure delivery API for transactional emails from websites and applications.

## Getting Started

To connect Census to Mailchimp Transactional (Mandrill), you'll need an API Key.

1. From the home page of your Mandrill account, click on [**Settings**](https://mandrillapp.com/settings) in the left hand navigation bar.
2. Click the **+ New API Key** button and create a new API key with the necessary permissions. Copy the generated API key.
   * Census requires at least the `Templates > List` and `Messages > Send-Template` permissions.

### Send Emails via Message Templates

Census takes advantage of Mandrill's templating system to send emails. When configuring a sync to Mandrill, the first step will be selecting the existing message template you'd like Census to use when sending.

In addition to the template, you can also map a number of other fields to control the email:

* To - The email address of the recipient.
* From - The email address of the sender.
* Attachments - URLs of files to attach to the email. These files must be publicly accessible.

Any additional custom fields provided by the sync configuration will be provided as merge variables to the Mandrill template.
