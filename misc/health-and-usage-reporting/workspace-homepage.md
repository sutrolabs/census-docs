# Workspace Homepage

{% hint style="warning" %}
This homepage is **not** meant as an accurate guide for billing. The homepage only represents currently-present syncs and does not account for any deleted syncs.

For accurate billing reporting, please use the [product-usage-dashboard.md](product-usage-dashboard.md "mention").
{% endhint %}

Your default Census landing page is the in-app homepage, also available at the top of your sidebar. This is a snapshot of your workspace health, with many levers for granularity:

* Filter to the last 12 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days of activity
* Display the aggregate of all records, or filter to successful vs. failed records
* Group by destination or by status
* Pick a single source or destination as a filter

Your workspaceâ€™s Open Alerts are also highlighted, so you can click into any syncs that may need immediate attention. [Learn more about alerting](https://docs.getcensus.com/basics/sync-monitoring/alerts).
