# Health and Usage Reporting

Census provides 2 forms of in-app health and usage reporting and [workspace-homepage.md](workspace-homepage.md "mention") and [product-usage-dashboard.md](product-usage-dashboard.md "mention").

This is in addition to all of the [sync-monitoring](../../syncs/sync-monitoring/ "mention") features meant to keep your day-to-day operations on track.
