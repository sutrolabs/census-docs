# Workspaces

Census Workspaces allow you to manage permissions granularly for different teams or use-cases. Give your Sales team and your Marketing team their own little slice of Census or keep your staging environment separate from prod. The list of Workspaces in your organization is always visible to all members of your organization, but you can control the level of access for members by assigning them a role.

## Creating a new Workspace

To get started creating a new Workspace, hit the "Create Workspace" button from your [organization dashboard](https://app.getcensus.com/home). Then simply name your new Workspace and you're done!

{% hint style="info" %}
The number of workspaces you can create is limited by which Census plan you use. Consult the [pricing page](https://getcensus.com/pricing) for more details.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Invite Users to a Workspace

You can invite users to a workspace. If the user you're inviting is not already a member of your Census organization, the invite will invite them to both the organization and the workspace.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
This means you may not be able to invite someone to the workspace if your organization has run out of seats.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If your plan includes [Access Controls,](role-based-access-controls.md) you'll be able to specify which role the user will have when they join the organization (the role options are are a function of which role you have as the inviter).

Users can be invited to any number of your workspaces and can have a different role for each workspace, as needed by your organization.
