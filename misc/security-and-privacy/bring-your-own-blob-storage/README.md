# Object Storage Providers

## ðŸ’½ How Census uses Object Storage

All sources configured using the [Advanced Sync Engine](../../../sources/overview/#sync-engines) use Amazon S3 as temporary storage for the data that is unloaded from your warehouse before it is sent to the destination service or application. Additionally, we will use this storage to write files containing information about record-level sync tracking, enabling detailed tracking and debugging of syncs. &#x20;

By default, Census manages this storage on your behalf. This includes managing credentials with narrow permissions and short lifetimes, encrypting dataat rest and in transit, and automatically removing old data once it is no longer in use. This approach is secure and is used by the vast majority of Census customers.

## Using your own Object Storage Provider
