# AI Prompts Recipe Book

**Why AI Columns?**

AI columns allow you to enrich, enhance, clean and classify data using LLMs. The potential is limitless, but we've shared our favorite prompts in this recipe book. Our team uses AI columns to:

* Enrich records with industry data, persona classifiers, or other personalization drivers.
* Layer sentiment analysis and other LLM capabilities into our Apollo data to drive automations
* Process large amounts of product usage data that just wouldn't be cost-effective in Salesforce or other end platforms
* Get around cumbersome formula fields in Salesforce
* Avoid writing complex regex to clean and format data

<summary>Analyze product usage trends to provide personalized support</summary>

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
````
Summarize the company's product usage trends over the last 30 days, focusing on key feature activity and highlighting any significant changes compared to the previous 30 days. Use a conversational style with bullet points to highlight key observations for sales talking points. Prioritize the following metrics for analysis:

- Sync Creation Attempts
- Model Creation
- New Sync Configurations
- Deleted or Paused Syncs
- Failed and Invalid Records by service_connection_type
- Records Updated by service_connection_type

Important: Any event in `{{ record['ACTIVITY_SUMMARY_JSON'] }}` that starts with `attempted_` or ends with `_deleted` or `_paused` should not be considered positive. These should be flagged for further investigation by the Customer Success team.

The following JSON includes fields that provide insights into their product usage:

1. `failed_records`: 
    - The number of failed syncs per service_connection_type. An increase in this indicates possible issues with syncs.

2. `invalid_records_sum`: 
    - The total number of invalid records by service_connection_type, signaling potential data issues. An increase in this indicates possible issues with model and dataset creation.

3. `records_updated_sum`: 
    - The number of records updated per service_connection_type, indicating active data syncing. An increase in this could indicate new and growing use cases which are positive. A decrease could indicate that a company is scaling back and something we should flag for the Customer Success team.

4. `activity_summary`: 
    - Provides a breakdown of sync creation attempts, model creation, new sync configurations, and syncs paused or deleted over the last 30 days compared to the previous 30 days.

Use the information from the provided JSON:

Failed, invalid, and successful records by service_connector_type: 
```
{{ record['WEEKLY_RECORDS_ACTIVITES'] }}
```
And the feature usage JSON:
```
{{ record['ACTIVITY_SUMMARY_JSON'] }}
```

---

Structure:

1. Overview of that data:
   - Summarize the company's product activity over the time period provided, focusing on key features such as sync creation, model creation, and new sync configurations.
   - Highlight any significant differences between the current and previous 30 days.
   - Highlight any significant increases or decrease in `records_updated`, `records_failed` or `reocrds_invalid`
   
2. Growth Signals & Potential Issues:
   - Identify areas of growth, such as an increase in model creation or sync configurations.
   - Flag potential concerns like decreases in sync creation, increases in invalid records, or events marked as `attempted_`, `_deleted`, or `_paused` for Customer Success follow-up.

3. Feature Usage Breakdown:
   - For each feature used (e.g., sync creation, model creation), provide details about the activity:
     - Sync Creation Attempts: How many syncs were attempted in the last 30 days? Is there a drop?
     - Model Creation: How many models were created, and does this suggest deeper product exploration?
     - Failed/Invalid Records: Were there increases in failed or invalid records? Flag these for Customer Success follow-up.
     - Records Updated: Were there any notable increases in records updated, signaling active syncing?
   
4. Service Connection Type Concerns:
   - Highlight any service_connection_types showing a growth in invalid or failed records, or events marked as `attempted_`, `_deleted`, or `_paused`. Provide specific details and suggest investigation.

5. Suggested Next Steps:
   - Suggest personalized actions for the Customer Success team, such as offering more resources, providing troubleshooting support for invalid records, or scheduling check-ins to resolve sync issues.
   - Encourage deeper engagement with underutilized features, particularly if certain features haven't been used in the last 15 days.

<details>

<summary>Analyze Traits: Identify High Value Customers</summary>

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
````

You are a data analyst. Using the customer data from the highest plan and the lowest plan, create a trait-by-trait analysis showing the likelihood of being a high-value customer.


For each trait in the data:
1. List each possible value within that trait
2. Calculate the ratio of that value appearing in the high-tier vs low-tier plan
3. Sort traits by their predictive strength (strongest correlation to weakest)


Format your output as:


TRAIT: [Name of Trait]
- VALUE: [Specific Value]
 - High Plan: [%]
 - Low Plan: [%]
 - LIKELIHOOD RATIO: [X]x more likely to be high-value
 Only include traits where there is at least a 10% difference between plans.
Sort values within each trait by likelihood ratio (highest to lowest).
```


This should generate output like:


```
TRAIT: Age Range
- VALUE: 18-25
 - High Plan: 40%
 - Low Plan: 28%
 - LIKELIHOOD RATIO: 1.43x more likely to be high-value


TRAIT: Visit Frequency
- VALUE: Daily
 - High Plan: 38%
 - Low Plan: 24%
 - LIKELIHOOD RATIO: 1.58x more likely to be high-value

LOYALTY_STATUS: 
MEMBERSHIP_PLAN: 
MEMBERSHIP_PRICE: 
PERSONAL_TRAINING_USAGE: 
PREFERRED_WORKOUT_TYPE: 
SIGNUP_DATE: 
USER_ID: 
VISIT_FREQUENCY: 
	1.	Sum the exact likelihood ratios for each matching trait.
	2.	Identify the top matching trait from the list based on the highest likelihood ratio.

Then output only the following:

	1.	Visit Frequency
	2.	Personal Training Usage
	3.	Loyalty Status
	4.	Gender
	5.	Fitness Goal
	6.	Age Range
	7.	Location

Output format:

Upsell Score: [High/Medium/Low]  
Top Trait: [Top_Trait_Name]

If the {{ record['DOMAIN_PAGE_DETAILS_JSON'] }} equals "Not enough activity to provide a summary," display the following message:  
**Not enough activity to provide a summary.**  

Otherwise, summarize the company's engagement and interest trends based on their web page interactions over the past 90 days.

```html
{{ record['DOMAIN_PAGE_DETAILS_JSON'] }}
```

Summarize the company's engagement using a conversational style with bullet points, focusing on the following prioritized pages and blog posts. If there are visits to non-prioritized pages (e.g., career, about) without visits to key pages, include them; otherwise, ignore. For customers with a `{{ record['SALES_STATUS'] }}` set to “Customer,” remember they are already paying for our product. It's still valuable to engage their team to explore potential future needs or improvements. For those marked as “Aware” or “Unaware,” they are in the early stages of the buying journey. Prospects with a `{{ record['SALES_STATUS'] }}` of “Ready to Engage” or “Engaged” are already in conversation with our sales team and likely evaluating specific solutions.

We also have `{{ record['INDUSTRY'] }}` for context. The higher the `{{ record['HEX_FIT_SCORE'] }}`, the more we want to pursue them, so prioritize accordingly.

```
Your task is to sort data into categories.
1. Consider the data in {{record['INDUSTRIES_GPT']}}
2. For each record, determine whether each response falls into the category of:
-Physical product
-Digital Product
-Services
-Other

Sort each row into its closest match. Return only one response for each row, and return only categories that exactly match those listed above.
```
