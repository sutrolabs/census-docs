# Smart Columns

Smart Columns gives you the ability to add additional columns to your datasets a variety of different ways that can be hard to do directly in SQL

* [**AI Columns**](ai-columns/) - Use an LLM of your choice to generate complex logic, format, or connect to tools
* [**Enrichment Columns**](enrichment/) - Connect to any HTTP API to populate your columns&#x20;
* [**Computed Columns**](computed-columns.md) - No-code way to define formulas and aggregations&#x20;
* [**Embedding Columns**](embedding-columns.md) - Use OpenAI to generate vector embeddings for your dataset, which can then be synced to vector databases like turbopuffer or Pinecone
