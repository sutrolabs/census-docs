# Semantic Layer

Different data sources have different behaviors and functionality. We encode these differences through different **Dataset Types**. You can learn more of the specific requirements, capabilities, and limitations for each within each section.

Datasets allow you to set icons and descriptions to help you identify and describe your data. For data that is countable (such as materialized data), you can also see the latest row count next to the dataset name.
