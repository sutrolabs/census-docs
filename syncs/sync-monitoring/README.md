  Census provides a variety of ways to understand the health and status of each
  of your syncs.

# Observability Toolkit

Each sync you set up has several different views into its status, recent activity and overall health. This includes:

* [Current Sync Run Overview](current-sync-run-overview.md) - A high level summary of the most recent status of the sync.
* [Sync History](sync-history.md) - A detailed log of all of the sync's activity history.
* [Sync Tracking](sync-tracking.md) - Row-level insight into each sync run.
* [API Inspector](api-inspector.md) - A view of recent API calls made to the destination service.

Additionally, you don't have to hang out looking at syncs all day to be sure they're healthy. Census also provides several features to keep an eye on the health of your syncs:

* [Sync Alerts](alerts.md) for when things need your attention.
* [Observability Lake](observability-lake.md) for long-term retention of sync logs, on your cloud storage.
* [Datadog Integration](datadog-integration.md) for hooking Census up to all your internal monitoring systems.&#x20;
* [Warehouse Writeback](warehouse-writeback.md) for keeping track of what your syncs have done historically.

Finally, if you're not ready to run your sync quite yet, you can always do a [Sync Dry Run](sync-dry-runs.md) to get a report of what changes it will make, before it makes them.
