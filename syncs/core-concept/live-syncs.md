# Live Syncs

Live Syncs are a type of sync that enable **real-time data activation**. In comparison with traditional "Triggered" syncs, they can provide single-second latency in activating data into a destination. Live syncs are available on our Enterprise plan. While a Live Sync is enabled, Census continually monitors the Source connection, ensuring that any new data is instantly captured and activated.

At this time, a sync's Run Mode (Live vs Triggered) cannot be changed after the sync has been created.

The following table summarizes the key differences between a Live and Triggered sync.



| Live                                          | Triggered                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Real-time; sub-second latency                 | Minimum latency at least a few minutes                                                                                  |
| Census monitors the source 24/7 automatically | Can be run manually, on a schedule, or via external triggers. See [triggering-syncs.md](triggering-syncs.md "mention"). |
| Only streaming-capable sources are supported  | All Source connections supported                                                                                        |
| Activates data as it changes                  | Activates records in batches                                                                                            |

### Supported Sources

Live Syncs are available for sources capable of streaming data, such as [Confluent Cloud](../../sources/confluent-cloud.md), [Kafka](../../sources/kafka.md), [Google PubSub](../../sources/google-pubsub.md), [Materialize](../../sources/materialize.md), [HTTP Requests](../../sources/http-request.md), [Snowflake](../../sources/snowflake.md), and [Databricks](../../sources/databricks.md)\*. Please feel free to [request a new integration](https://www.getcensus.com/request-an-integration?hsCtaTracking=a5c60288-2577-4ade-8fc6-e453ba20cd0d%7C5f94cdfe-1f8f-457f-8e34-80e2af1c9fb2) if your streaming infrastructure is not yet supported.

\* Coming soon. Email support@getcensus.com to be added to the private preview.

### Supported Destinations

Live Syncs can activate data in real time in all Census destinations with a few exceptions:

* Amazon S3
* Anaplan
* Azure Blob Storage
* Box
* Customer.io Collections
* Google Analytics (UA)
* Google Cloud Storage
